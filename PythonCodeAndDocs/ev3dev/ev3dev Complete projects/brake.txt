stop() command can be used in three ways:
+coast
+break
+hold
stop_action='coast' is probably rarely used.
The stop_action mode should be set just once and as early in the script 
as possible.

IT'S MUCH BETTER USING BREAK
-------------------------
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from ev3dev.ev3 import *

mB = LargeMotor('outB')
mC = LargeMotor('outC')

mB.stop()
mC.stop()

# to make extra sure the motors have stopped:
mB.run_forever(speed_sp=0)
mC.run_forever(speed_sp=0)


or we can do:

mB.stop(stop_action = "hold")
