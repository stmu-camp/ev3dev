Use run_to_rel_pos(position_sp=<angle in degrees>, speed_sp=<value>).
If you want to motor to run backwards then use a negative value for 
position_sp rather than for speed_sp. Using a negative value for speed_sp 
will not work because the sign of speed_sp is ignored by this command 
(but not by others). Use speed_sp values between 0 and 1000.


Example:
To make a large motor on port B turn through 360 degrees at speed 900
and optionally apply a 'hold' (like a strong brake - see later):


#!/usr/bin/env python3
# so that script can be run from Brickman

from ev3dev.ev3 import *
from time import sleep

m = LargeMotor('outB')

m.run_to_rel_pos(position_sp=360, speed_sp=900, stop_action="hold")

sleep(5)   # Give the motor time to move
