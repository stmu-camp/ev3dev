--------------------------------------------
//stop_action  is set to  'hold'  which makes an active, forceful effort
to stop the motor turning.
//you can use  stop_action="coast" which lets the motor continue to turn
 until stopped by friction. 

Also, the second run_forever command will use the remembered value for 
speed_sp since none was specified.
